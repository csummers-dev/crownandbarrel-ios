# ✨ Collection Entry Detail View Redesign - Clean, Elegant, Scannable

## Overview

This PR completely redesigns the watch collection entry detail view to provide an elegant, friction-free viewing experience. The new design eliminates expand/collapse sections in favor of a single-scroll layout that displays all watch information with smart field visibility, prominent statistics, and a luxury aesthetic matching the app's collection list view.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The existing collection entry view had usability issues:
- **Hidden Information**: Expand/collapse sections required multiple taps to see all watch details
- **Fragmented Experience**: Important information buried behind interaction barriers
- **Inconsistent Design**: Didn't match the luxury aesthetic of the collection list view
- **Poor Scannability**: Users couldn't quickly reference watch details
- **Missing Statistics**: Wear count and activity metrics not prominently displayed

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Complete View Redesign
- **Removed all CollapsibleSection components** for immediate access to all information
- **Implemented single-scroll layout** with clear visual hierarchy
- **Smart field visibility** - only shows fields that contain data (no empty placeholders)
- **Prominent statistics** - times worn, last worn, achievement progress featured prominently
- **Luxury typography** - serif fonts for headings/brands, matching collection view style
- **Consistent spacing** - AppSpacing tokens throughout (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)

### Visual Hierarchy (Top to Bottom)
1. **Photo Gallery Carousel** - TabView with page indicators for all watch photos
2. **Watch Identity** - Manufacturer + Model in luxury serif, line, reference, nickname
3. **Statistics Section** - Times worn, last worn date, achievement progress
4. **Core Details** - Serial number, production year, country, limited edition, notes, tags
5. **Technical Specifications** (8 groups, shown only when populated):
   - Case Specifications (11 fields)
   - Dial Details (8 fields)
   - Crystal (3 fields)
   - Movement (7 fields)
   - Water Resistance (3 fields)
   - Strap/Bracelet (7 fields)
   - Ownership Information (9 fields)
6. **Child Collections** - Service history, valuations, strap inventory
7. **Achievements** - Horizontal wrapping row at bottom with badges

### New Components & Utilities

**UI Components (5 new):**
- `DetailSectionHeader` - Luxury serif section headers
- `StatisticRow` - Prominent metric display with icons
- `AchievementBadge` - Compact 60x60pt badges for horizontal display
- `SpecificationRow` - Smart key-value pairs with failable initializers
- `TagPill` & `TagPillGroup` - Tag chips with FlowLayout for wrapping
- `FlowLayout` - Public reusable layout for horizontal wrapping

**Formatting Utilities (2 new):**
- `DateFormatters` - Smart relative/absolute date formatting
  - Relative for < 7 days: "Today", "Yesterday", "3 days ago"
  - Absolute for older dates: "Jan 15, 2025"
  - Specialized formats: month/year, duration, days between
- `WatchFieldFormatters` - Comprehensive field formatting
  - Smart decimal precision (40mm vs 40.5mm)
  - Currency formatting with locale support
  - Group visibility helpers for all specification groups
  - Specialized formatters: frequency (vph), power reserve, accuracy

**Repository Enhancement:**
- Added `lastWornDate(watchId:)` method to fetch most recent wear date
- Efficient GRDB query using CodingKeys for proper UUID filtering

## 📊 Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Pattern**: SwiftUI compositional views with computed properties
- **Data Loading**: Async/await for statistics and achievements
- **Visibility Logic**: Computed properties check field population before rendering
- **Performance**: Efficient queries, minimal database hits

### Smart Field Visibility Rules (Per PRD)
- **String fields**: Hide if nil or empty
- **Numeric fields**: Hide if nil
- **Date fields**: Hide if nil
- **Enum fields**: Hide if nil
- **Boolean fields**: Only show if true (e.g., "Crown Guard" only appears when crownGuard == true)
- **Collections**: Hide entire section if empty
- **Groups**: Section headers only appear when at least one field in group is populated

### Field Formatting
- **Measurements**: Smart decimal display (40mm vs 40.5mm)
- **Currency**: Locale-aware formatting with currency code ("$1,250 USD")
- **Dates**: Smart relative/absolute switching (< 7 days = relative)
- **Enums**: snake_case and camelCase converted to Title Case
- **Specialized**: Frequency (28,800 vph), power reserve (38 hours), accuracy (±2.5 sec/day)

## 🧪 Testing

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Per PRD Requirements
1. **No Expand/Collapse** - All information visible in single scroll (FR7.1)
2. **Field Visibility** - Empty fields completely hidden (FR8.1-FR8.6)
3. **Visual Hierarchy** - Photos → Brand → Statistics → Details → Achievements (FR7.5)
4. **Typography** - Serif for headings/brands, sans-serif for body (FR7.3)
5. **Spacing** - Consistent AppSpacing tokens throughout (FR7.2)
6. **Achievements** - Horizontal row with wrapping at bottom (FR6.1-FR6.3)

### User Experience Improvements
- **Quick Access**: Users can find any detail within 5 seconds (down from multi-tap process)
- **Tailored Display**: View adapts to show only relevant information
- **Visual Consistency**: Matches collection list view aesthetic
- **Engagement**: Statistics make wear patterns immediately visible

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
❌ **None** - Fully backward compatible

### Deprecations
- `CollapsibleSection` component no longer used in detail view (still available for other views)
- Old `KeyValueRow` component removed (replaced by `SpecificationRow`)

### Data Model Changes
❌ **None** - No database schema changes required

## 📸 Visual Changes

### Before
- Collapsible sections (Core, Additional Details, Achievements)
- Everything hidden behind expand controls
- Limited visual hierarchy
- Statistics not prominently displayed

### After
- Single-scroll layout with all information visible
- Clear visual hierarchy: Photos → Identity → Stats → Specs → Achievements
- Statistics prominently featured (times worn, last worn)
- Smart field visibility (only shows populated fields)
- Luxury typography and consistent spacing
- Achievement badges in horizontal wrapping row
- Tag pills instead of comma-separated list
- Child collections (service history, valuations, straps) with proper formatting

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- **Efficient Queries**: lastWornDate uses indexed GRDB query
- **Computed Properties**: Field visibility checked lazily
- **Photo Loading**: Uses thumbnails from PhotoStoreV2 cache
- **Minimal Redraws**: Theme token for controlled updates

### Resource Impact
- **Database**: 1 additional query (lastWornDate) per view load
- **Memory**: Negligible increase (all data already loaded for watch object)
- **UI Rendering**: Comparable to previous implementation (similar component count)

## 🙏 Review Notes

### Key Areas to Review
1. **Visual Hierarchy** - Verify photos → identity → stats → details flow feels natural

4. **Achievement Wrapping** - Check achievement badges wrap properly on smaller screens
5. **Typography** - Verify luxury serif fonts appear correctly on all devices

### Testing Recommendations
1. Open a watch with minimal data (only manufacturer + model)
2. Open a watch with extensive data across all fields
3. Check a watch with 0 wears vs many wears
4. Verify theme changes update all sections properly
5. Test on iPhone SE (smallest screen) and iPhone Pro Max (largest)

## 📦 Deployment
