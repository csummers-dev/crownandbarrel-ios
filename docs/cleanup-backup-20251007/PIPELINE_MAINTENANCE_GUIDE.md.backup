# Pipeline Maintenance Guide

This guide ensures consistent maintenance across all CI/CD workflows and prevents issues like missed updates during pipeline fixes.

## Overview

The CrownAndBarrel iOS project has **8 GitHub Actions workflows** that require consistent maintenance. This guide provides systematic procedures to ensure all workflows are updated together and no components are missed during fixes.

## Workflow Inventory

### Complete List of Workflows

| Workflow File | Purpose | Key Components |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Main CI/CD pipeline | Build, test, lint, deploy |
| `.github/workflows/security.yml` | Security scanning | CodeQL, dependency scan, secret scan |
| `.github/workflows/validate.yml` | Code validation | SwiftLint, build performance |
| `.github/workflows/performance-monitor.yml` | Performance monitoring | Build metrics, test timing |
| `.github/workflows/ios-ci.yml` | iOS-specific CI | Unit tests, UI tests |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Release management | TestFlight, App Store deployment |
| `.github/workflows/dependency-update.yml` | Dependency updates | Dependabot automation |
| `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml` | Security auditing | Additional security checks |

## Maintenance Procedures

### 1. Before Making Any Pipeline Changes

**Always run this checklist:**

```bash
# 1. List all workflow files
find .github/workflows -name "*.yml" -type f

# 2. Verify workflow syntax
for file in .github/workflows/*.yml; do
  echo "Checking $file..."
  python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('$file'))" || echo "‚ùå $file has syntax errors"
done

# 3. Check for common patterns that need updating
grep -r "xcodegen" .github/workflows/
grep -r "xcodebuild" .github/workflows/
grep -r "destination.*generic" .github/workflows/
```

### 2. Systematic Update Process

When fixing pipeline issues, **ALWAYS** follow this process:

#### Step 1: Identify All Affected Workflows
```bash
# Search for the problematic pattern across ALL workflows
grep -r "PROBLEM_PATTERN" .github/workflows/
```

#### Step 2: Create Update Checklist
Create a checklist for each workflow file:
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/security.yml` 
- [ ] `.github/workflows/validate.yml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/performance-monitor.yml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ios-ci.yml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/dependency-update.yml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml`

#### Step 3: Apply Changes Systematically
1. **Update each workflow file** using the same fix
2. **Test locally** if possible
3. **Commit each workflow separately** with descriptive messages
4. **Verify all workflows** before pushing

#### Step 4: Final Verification
```bash
# Verify all workflows have been updated
grep -r "OLD_PATTERN" .github/workflows/ || echo "‚úÖ All workflows updated"

# Check for consistency
grep -r "NEW_PATTERN" .github/workflows/ | wc -l
```

### 3. Common Patterns That Need Consistent Updates

#### XcodeGen Installation
**Pattern to search for:** `xcodegen.zip` or `xcodegen generate`
**Files typically affected:** All workflows that generate Xcode projects

#### Simulator Destinations
**Pattern to search for:** `generic/platform=iOS Simulator`
**Files typically affected:** All workflows that build or test iOS apps

#### Build Settings
**Pattern to search for:** `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`
**Files typically affected:** All workflows that compile iOS code

#### Homebrew Installation
**Pattern to search for:** `brew install`
**Files typically affected:** All workflows that install dependencies

### 4. Quality Assurance Checklist

Before committing pipeline changes:

- [ ] **All 8 workflow files reviewed**
- [ ] **Same fix applied consistently** across all relevant workflows
- [ ] **No workflow left with old pattern**
- [ ] **Local testing completed** (if applicable)
- [ ] **Commit messages are descriptive** and reference all affected files
- [ ] **Pre-push validation passes**

### 5. Emergency Fix Procedures

For urgent pipeline fixes:

1. **Stop and assess** - Don't rush the fix
2. **Create the checklist** first
3. **Apply systematically** - don't skip workflows
4. **Test incrementally** - commit each workflow separately
5. **Verify completeness** before marking as resolved

## Historical Issues and Lessons Learned

### Issue: CodeQL Build Destination Missed (2025-09-20)

**What happened:** The security workflow's CodeQL build step was missed during simulator destination fixes.

**Root cause:** Incomplete systematic review - only main CI workflows were updated.

**Prevention:** Always search for ALL patterns across ALL workflow files before making changes.

**Command to prevent this:**
```bash
grep -r "destination.*generic" .github/workflows/
```

### Issue: XcodeGen PATH Issues (2025-09-20)

**What happened:** Some workflows had separate install/generate steps causing PATH issues.

**Root cause:** Inconsistent installation patterns across workflows.

**Prevention:** Use the same installation pattern across all workflows.

### Issue: Homebrew Architecture Conflicts (2025-09-20)

**What happened:** ARM64/x86_64 conflicts in dependency installation.

**Root cause:** Not all workflows used the robust 3-tier installation strategy.

**Prevention:** Apply the same installation strategy to all workflows.

## Automation Scripts

### Workflow Consistency Checker

Create this script to verify workflow consistency:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# workflow-consistency-check.sh

echo "üîç Checking workflow consistency..."

# Check for common patterns that should be consistent
PATTERNS=(
    "xcodegen.zip"
    "generic/platform=iOS Simulator"
    "IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET"
    "brew install"
)

for pattern in "${PATTERNS[@]}"; do
    echo "Checking pattern: $pattern"
    matches=$(grep -r "$pattern" .github/workflows/ | wc -l)
    echo "Found $matches occurrences"
    
    if [ $matches -gt 0 ]; then
        echo "Files with '$pattern':"
        grep -r "$pattern" .github/workflows/ | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq
    fi
    echo "---"
done
```

### Workflow Update Template

When making systematic updates, use this template:

```markdown
## Pipeline Update: [ISSUE_NAME]

### Affected Workflows
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/security.yml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/validate.yml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/performance-monitor.yml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ios-ci.yml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/dependency-update.yml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml`

### Change Description
[Describe what needs to be changed and why]

### Search Pattern
[The grep pattern used to find affected files]

### Verification Command
[Command to verify all workflows were updated]

### Testing
- [ ] Local testing completed
- [ ] All workflows updated consistently
- [ ] No old patterns remaining
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Never Update Workflows Individually
Always search for patterns across ALL workflows before making changes.

### 2. Use Descriptive Commit Messages
Include all affected workflow files in commit messages:
```
Fix simulator destinations in ci.yml, security.yml, validate.yml, performance-monitor.yml
```

### 3. Test Incrementally
Commit each workflow separately to make debugging easier.

### 4. Document Changes
Update this maintenance guide when new patterns or workflows are added.

### 5. Regular Audits
Run the consistency checker regularly to catch drift.
