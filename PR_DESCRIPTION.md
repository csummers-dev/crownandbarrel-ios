Implement Comprehensive Haptics, Luxury Themes, Typography System, and iOS 26.0 UI Enhancements

## Overview

This comprehensive feature implementation transforms Crown & Barrel into a premium luxury timepiece application with sophisticated user experience enhancements. The implementation includes a complete haptic feedback system, curated luxury theme collection, refined typography hierarchy, and iOS 26.0 UI compliance with extensive testing coverage.

## Key Features Implemented

### Haptic Feedback System
- **Navigation haptics** for tab switching and settings menu interactions
- **Collection haptics** for add watch button and item selection feedback
- **Debounced implementation** preventing haptic spam during rapid user interactions
- **Contextual feedback patterns** tailored to specific interaction types
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with both UI and unit tests

### Luxury Theme Collection
- **Eight curated luxury themes** designed with professional color theory principles
- **Light themes**: Champagne Gold, Royal Sapphire, Emerald Heritage with sophisticated palettes
- **Dark themes**: Onyx Prestige, Burgundy Elite, Midnight Platinum with refined contrast
- **Enhanced Daytime and Nighttime** themes with improved color harmony
- **Immediate theme updates** with real-time UI synchronization across all elements

### Sophisticated Typography System
- **Luxury typography hierarchy** combining serif elegance with sans-serif clarity
- **Selective serif application** for navigation titles and watch manufacturer names
- **Optimized token system** reduced from 12 to 4 essential typography tokens
- **iOS 26.0 compliance** with modern typography standards
- **Brand consistency** throughout the application interface

### iOS 26.0 UI Enhancements
- **Liquid Glass search fields** with 18pt corner radius matching iOS 26.0 specifications
- **Immediate tab bar color updates** eliminating previous delay issues
- **Enhanced visual hierarchy** with improved contrast and readability
- **Launch screen typography** using serif fonts for brand consistency

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Improvements

### Search Field Enhancement
- **Multi-layer styling approach** with five different techniques for maximum compatibility
- **iOS 26.0 Liquid Glass compliance** with proper corner radius implementation
- **Aggressive color override** preventing system defaults from interfering with theme colors
- **Runtime refresh mechanism** ensuring immediate color updates on theme changes

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced haptic feedback** preventing performance degradation during rapid interactions
- **Optimized typography system** removing unused tokens and reducing memory footprint
- **Efficient theme changes** with minimal overhead and maximum visual impact
- **Clean refresh mechanisms** eliminating side effects and unexpected behavior
